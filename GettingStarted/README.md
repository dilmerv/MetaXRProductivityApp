# Few Requirements:

- Be sure to go to Window > Package Manager > add package from Git URL > [git@github.com:dilmerv/com.learnxr.core.git](git@github.com:dilmerv/com.learnxr.core.git)
- The Meta_Productivity_App.zip in this directory contains a basic UI with Poke interactions. Meta provides a variety of examples, but if you prefer to follow along with my video, extract the file and drag and drop the contents into your Unity project.
